Bingo. A game that has been played for over one thousand years. If you were to glance inside your local bingo hall this evening you might think some of the patrons had been playing for almost as long. If bingo is to survive It's clear that the game needs to find some way to appeal to the youth market. And what do today's youth like more than anything else? The internet of course.

From this flawless logic comes the concept of 'Webingo'. A variation on a timeless classic which dispenses with the use of  mere numbers and engages instead with HTTP response codes, the electronic heartbeat behind all our favorite websites.

Webingo! What better way to guarantee bingo's success for the next thousand years?
